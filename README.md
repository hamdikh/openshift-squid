**Squid Proxy s2i image for OpenShift v3**
========================================================
 The procedure described in the following steps shows the approach to create a s2i (Source-to-image) ready-to-run Docker image with sourcecode injected from a Git repository. This Docker image can be run on any Docker Daemon or it can be pushed to a private Docker registry and then be referenced by an OpenShift application as an imagestream.
 
 The underlying example is a Squid proxy which can proxy traffic from other Docker containers to the outside. The config file squid.conf can be put in a Git repository and injected when the s2i build process is started. There is also a whitelist which is referenced by the squid.conf.
 
 There are two options. The first one is to clone this Git repository and run the Makefile to create a Docker builder image.  You can push this builder image to the private Docker registry in OpenShift to create an imagestream. Afterwards you can create a new app in OpenShift and reference the imagestream and the Git repository. The procedure is described in **"How to use the Git repository"**. 
 The other option is two download the s2i standalone tool and run s2i create to get a s2i structure which can be configured according to the application which shall be created. If you want to create your own application image continue at **"S2I installation routine"**.

What is inside the git repository
---------------------------------
 - .s2i scripts: 
	- assemble
	- run
	- save-artifacts
	- usage
 - Sourcecode in /src folder
 - Dockerfile
 - Makefile

How to use the Git repository
-----------------------------
 1. Clone the git repository:	
`$ git clone https://github.com/<repo_name>`
 2. Build the Docker builder image:	
`$ docker build -t <docker_image> .` or just run the Makefile (image name can be configured).
 3. Push the Docker builder image to the private OpenShift Docker registry to create a new imagestream (see https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/registry/accessing_registry.html#access)
 4. Create a new application in Openshift and reference the imagestream (created in step 3) and the git repository:	
`$ oc new-app <repo_name>/<image_name>~https://github.com/openshift/<repo_name>.git`
 5. Check your application in the web UI or over cli:
`$ oc get pod`

s2i installation routine
------------------------
 - Install Docker version 1.12.6 (this version is currently used in OpenShift)
 - Install Go version 1.8.x
	 - Install via yum installer:
	 `$ sudo yum install go`
	 - Check if Go is correctly installed:
	 `go version`

 - Install s2i:
	 - Get source-to-image:	
	 `$ go get github.com/openshift/source-to-image`
	 - Change to directory (GOPATH must be set before):	
	 `$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/openshift/source-to-image`
	 - Export s2i bin to PATH:	
	 `$ export PATH=$PATH:${GOPATH}/src/github.com/openshift/source-to-image/_output/local/bin/linux/amd64/`
	 - This script sets up a go workspace locally and builds all go components:	
	 `$ hack/build-go.sh`

Customise Docker builder image
---------------------------
 - Create the s2i structure with all mandatory files in a target directory:	
 `$ S2I create <builder_image_name> <target_directory>`
 
 - Edit the Dockerfile according to your needs, e.g.:	
 `yum install <package> && yum update && yum clean all -y`
 
 - Edit .s2i/bin/assemble file, copy config files, etc..
 - Edit .s2i/bin/run file, start up the application, e.g.:	
 `exec squid -f /etc/squid/squid.conf -N` 

Create Docker builder image
---------------------------
 - Build the Docker builder image:	
 `$ docker build -t <builder_image_name>`
 - Now build the Docker application image (builder image must be present!), the sourcecode can be in local directory or Git repo:		`$ s2i build <sourcecode> <builder_image_name> <output_application_name>` 
 - Test the application image:	
 `$ docker run -p <port>:<port> <output_application_name>`

Create the application in OpenShift
------------------
 - Set up a Git repository with source code and config files in root directory.
 - Optional: Push the local Docker image to the private Docker registry. This way the imagestream is automatically created. The imagestream can then be used in the app creation.
 - Go to project default to create the new app. Project default pods can be accessed by every pod:	
 `$ oc project default`
 - Create a new application:	
 `$ oc new-app <repo_name>/<output_application_name>~https://github.com/openshift/<repo_name>.git`
 - Check with following command if the application is running:	
 `$ oc get pod`

Use the application in OpenShift
------------------
- Log into project default:	
`$ oc project default`
- Get the service ip address of the pod (needed when the application should be accessed by other pods):		
`$ oc get service`
- Scale up the application to more replicas (traffic will be distributed over the internal loadbalancer, the pod addresses are stored in the service pool):		
`$ oc get dc`	
`$ oc scale up dc <dc_name> --replicas=2`

Configuration of proxy in pod, node or (operation) system wide
------------------
- Proxy settings for pod: Configure pod to redirect traffic to the Squid proxy:		
`$ oc env dc/frontend HTTP_PROXY=http://IPADDR:PORT`
- Proxy settings for node: Configure node to redirect traffic to the Squid proxy:	
`export http_proxy=http://squid.squid.<yourdomain>:3128`	
`export https_proxy=http://squid.squid.<yourdomain>:3128`
- Proxy settings for operation system: Configure iptables to redirect traffic to the Squid proxy:	
`$ iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to 3128 -w`

Test the proxy
------------------
- You can curl the Squid proxy at its service address in OpenShift:		
`$ curl --proxy http://<service_ip_addr>:3128 http://www.google.com`
- Or when you run it on Docker you can test it locally:		
`$ curl --proxy http://localhost:3128 http://www.google.com`
